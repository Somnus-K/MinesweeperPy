# MinesweeperPy
 A simple Minesweeper game made in Python as a fun small side project. All the files and assets are included into the repository as well as the .exe build. 
 
 If you wish to build the .exe yourself for safety reasons you can put the following command in the terminal when in the repo directory. 
 
 ```pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --add-data "Assets;Assets" main.py```
 
 This only requires to have pygame and pyinstaller packages installed into your computer's version of Python.
